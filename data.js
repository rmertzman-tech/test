            assemblyHistory: `
                <p><strong>Early Formation (469-450 BCE):</strong> Socrates's Personal Reality Framework emerged during the height of Athenian democracy and cultural achievement. Born to a stonemason and a midwife, this background embedded an appreciation for practical knowledge and service. Growing up during Athens's golden age under Pericles, he had direct exposure to democratic participation, sophistic education, and cultural innovation.</p>
                <p><strong>Philosophical Awakening and Method Development (450-430 BCE):</strong> The declaration from the Oracle of Delphi that no one was wiser than Socrates precipitated a systematic investigation of various claims to knowledge. This led to the development of his systematic questioning techniques (elenchus) to test moral and intellectual claims through rigorous logical analysis, revealing hidden assumptions and contradictions.</p>
                <p><strong>Teaching and Public Engagement (430-399 BCE):</strong> Socrates's mature period involved applying his philosophical method in public spaces, making philosophical inquiry accessible to ordinary citizens while challenging conventional assumptions about knowledge, virtue, and political authority. His trial and death demonstrated his ultimate commitment to the examined life over mere survival.</p>`,
            broa: `
                <p><strong>Belief System (B):</strong> He held that genuine knowledge and virtue are identical, and that all moral failure results from ignorance about what is truly good. He famously stated, "The unexamined life is not worth living for a human being," prioritizing the soul's condition over material wealth or reputation.</p>
                <p><strong>Rule System (R):</strong> He subjected all important beliefs to rigorous logical examination through systematic questioning. He believed in living according to philosophical conclusions regardless of social consequences, demonstrating that conviction must guide action.</p>
                <p><strong>Ontological Commitments (O):</strong> He held a dualistic view where the soul is distinct from and more important than the body. He believed in an objective moral reality, where truths like justice and wisdom exist independently of human opinion, discoverable through reason.</p>
                <p><strong>Authenticity Criteria (A+):</strong> Authentic existence requires a perfect alignment between philosophical convictions and practical action. It demands intellectual humility—recognizing the limits of one's knowledge—and an unwavering commitment to ongoing inquiry.</p>`,
            atcf: "Successfully integrated his artisan background, military service, and traditional religious formation while developing revolutionary approaches to philosophical inquiry. Throughout his life, he maintained a coherent coordination of philosophical investigation and civic engagement without fragmenting his identity or compromising his essential principles.",
            fop: "His primary future-oriented project was the legacy of his philosophical method. He established systematic approaches to rational inquiry that could serve ongoing philosophical investigation and moral education across different historical circumstances, cementing the ideal of the 'examined life' for Western thought.",
