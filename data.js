                Socrates: A PRF Analysis of Philosophical Inquiry and Examined Life
                Personal Reality Framework Analysis (469-399 BCE)
                Note: This analysis necessarily relies on reconstructive interpretation of Socrates through the accounts of Plato, Xenophon, and Aristophanes, as Socrates wrote no philosophical works himself.
                
                Assembly History: From Artisan Athens to Philosophical Mission
                - Early Formation (469-450 BCE): Socrates's PRF emerged during the height of Athenian democracy. Born to a stonemason and a midwife, this background embedded appreciation for practical knowledge. His military service demonstrated physical courage.
                - Philosophical Awakening (450-430 BCE): The Oracle of Delphi's declaration that no one was wiser than Socrates precipitated his systematic investigation of various claims to knowledge, revealing that experts lacked genuine understanding. He developed his systematic questioning techniques (elenchus).
                - Teaching and Public Engagement (430-399 BCE): Socrates's mature period involved applying his philosophical method in public spaces, making inquiry accessible. His trial and death demonstrated ultimate commitment to the examined life over mere survival.

                - Ontological Commitments (O): Soul-Body Dualism: The soul is distinct from and more important than the body. Objective Moral Reality: Moral truths (Justice, Courage) exist independently of human opinion.
                - Authenticity Criteria (A+): Philosophical-Practical Integration: Authentic existence requires alignment between philosophical convictions and practical action. Intellectual Humility and Moral Independence are key.

                Future-Oriented Projections (FOP): Legacy of the Socratic method. Established critical self-reflection as essential for authentic human existence. A model for integrating philosophical conviction with responsible political engagement.
                
                Key Life Transitions: From Conventional Citizen to Philosophical Inquirer, Private Investigation to Public Teaching, and ultimately Defendant to Philosophical Martyr, showing ultimate coherence.

                Personal Reality Framework Analysis (1929-1968)

                Assembly History: From Privileged Preacher to Universal Liberation Theologian
                - Early Formation (1929-1948): Emerged from the Black Baptist intellectual tradition and elite education, synthesizing spiritual traditions with academic theology.
                - Montgomery Leadership Development (1955-1960): His leadership of the bus boycott demonstrated his capacity for coordinating diverse communities. He synthesized Gandhian methods with the Christian social gospel.
                - National Movement Leadership (1960-1968): As SCLC leader, he articulated the "Beloved Community" as the ultimate goal and later expanded his focus from racial to economic justice.

                Personal Reality Framework Configuration (BROA+)
                - Belief System (B): Divine Image Universal: All humans bear God's image, making segregation blasphemous. Beloved Community Possibility: Christian love (agape) can transform society.
                - Rule System (R): Nonviolent Discipline Absolute: Unwavering commitment to nonviolence, even when met with violence. Enemy Transformation Priority: Focus on converting opponents, not defeating them.
                - Ontological Commitments (O): Moral Universe Arc: Reality is structured toward justice. Redemptive Suffering: Voluntary suffering for justice can be transformative.
                - Authenticity Criteria (A+): Spiritual-Political Synthesis: Authentic leadership required coordinating Christian commitment with effective political action.

                Coordination Capabilities (C): Multi-Constituency Communication, Strategic-Spiritual Integration, Mass Movement Leadership, Prophetic Authority Exercise.

                Adaptive Temporal Coherence Function (ATCF): Successfully integrated his background, training, and leadership roles, maintaining a coherent spiritual voice and expanding his understanding of systemic injustice over time.

                Future-Oriented Projections (FOP): Beloved Community Realization: Developing frameworks for inclusive democratic communities. Global Nonviolent Movement: Extending his methodology to global liberation struggles.
