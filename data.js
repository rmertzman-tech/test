                <p class="mb-2">The NFL's chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) crisis serves as a powerful real-world example of the principles outlined in this lab. Initially, the NFL operated with a monopolistic goal: protecting the league's institutional interests. This failed to align with other stakeholders.</p>
                <p class="mb-2">A transformation occurred when a diverse network of actors began to coordinate around a shared network-goal: <strong>'establishing the truth about CTE and preventing future harm.'</strong></p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2 text-sm">
                    <li><strong>Families</strong> demonstrated <strong>Bootstrap Authority</strong>. Without formal credentials, their lived experience and moral testimony gave them the legitimacy to demand action.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scientists</strong> (like Dr. Bennet Omalu and Dr. Ann McKee) provided the empirical evidence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Journalists</strong> amplified the findings and stories, creating public pressure.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mt-2">These groups demonstrated <strong>Capability Equivalence</strong>. They used different methods (testimony, research, reporting) but all advanced the same shared objective. Their coordination was not based on agreeing on a single method, but on recognizing that their different capabilities were functionally equivalent in pursuing the network goal. This case study shows how ethical authority can emerge from demonstrated competence and how diverse groups can achieve powerful coordination without needing to abandon their unique approaches.</p>
